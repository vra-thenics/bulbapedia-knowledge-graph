# 🌟 Welcome to the Bulbapedia Knowledge Graph Repository! 🌟

## Repository Name: bulbapedia-knowledge-graph
## Repository Description:
Are you a Pokémon enthusiast looking to explore the world of Pokémon in a new and exciting way? Look no further! "Bulbapedia Knowledge Graph" is a Semantic Web application that creates a comprehensive Knowledge Graph (KG) using data from Bulbapedia. Just like how DBpedia was built from Wikipedia, this project captures Pokémon data from Bulbapedia, converts it into RDF format, and offers various interfaces to access and query the resulting knowledge graph.

Dive into the vast world of Pokémon, discover intricate connections, and unravel the mysteries hiding within the Bulbapedia Knowledge Graph. Whether you're a researcher, developer, or simply a curious fan, this project opens up a new realm of possibilities for exploring Pokémon data in a structured and meaningful way.
